# TicketsSystem-
The "Event Ticket Purchasing System" project is an example of a straightforward ticket purchasing system written in C++. The project enables customers to explore the repertoire, reserve tickets, and view their booked seats.

**Opportunieties for developing the project**
1. The project could be expanded by adding a payment module that would allow customers to pay for their booked tickets online. Technically, the payment module will be integrated with the ticket purchasing system, allowing customers to select their preferred payment method, process transactions and confirm payments made.
2. As part of the expansion of the project, you can add an administration panel that will enable you to manage the repertoire, customer data and tickets, as well as monitor ticket sales. The administration panel will enable the administrator to add, delete and edit events in the repertoire, which will ensure flexible management of available events. Thanks to this, the administrator will have full control over the content of the repertoire and the ability to quickly respond to changes and updates.
3. To increase the level of confidentiality of customer data, advanced methods of encrypting the file storing logins and passwords for accounts can be implemented. The use of strong cryptographic algorithms will enable effective protection of this information against unauthorized access. Implementing these technical measures will ensure that customer login details and passwords are protected against possible attacks and unauthorized access.
4. The use of an additional SQL language will allow you to easily create database queries, which will allow you to quickly download and manipulate data regarding events, customers and tickets. Additionally, SQL will enable filtering, sorting and combining data, which will provide more flexible and advanced database operations.
